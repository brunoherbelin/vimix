summary: Video live mixer
title: vimix
description: |
   vimix performs graphical mixing and blending of several movie clips and
   computer generated graphics, with image processing effects in real-time.
   Its intuitive and hands-on user interface gives direct control on image opacity and
   shape for producing live graphics during concerts and VJ-ing sessions.
   The ouput image is typically projected full-screen on an external
   monitor or a projector, but can be recorded and streamed live (no audio).
